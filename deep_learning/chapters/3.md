# Probability and Information Theory

## Introduction

Probability Theory is a mathematical framework for representing uncertainty.

> It provides a means of quantifying uncertainty as well as axioms for deriving new uncertain statements.

In AI applications, probability theory is used in two major ways. First, the laws of probability tell us how systems should reason.

Second, we use probability and statistics to analyze behavior of proposed AI systems.

> While probability theory allows us to make uncertain statements and to reason in the presence of uncertainty, information theory enables us to quantify the amount of uncertainty in a probability distribution.
