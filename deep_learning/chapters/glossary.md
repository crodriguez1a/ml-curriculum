# Linear Algebra

- **Scalars**: A scalar is just a single number, in contrast to most other objects studied in linear algebra, which are usually arrays of multiple numbers.

- **Vectors**: A vector is an array of numbers. The numbers are arranged in order.

- **Matrices**: A matrix is a 2-D array of numbers, so each element is identified by two indices instead of just one.

- **Tensors**: In some cases we will need an array with more than two axes. In the general case, an array of numbers arranged on a regular grid with a variable number of axes is known as a tensor.

- **Transpose**: A matrix operation that outputs the mirror image of the matrix across a diagonal line, called the **main diagonal**.
