## How to use this reference:

Each file contains a **subjective** paraphrasing of the concepts covered in each chapter. Notes should not be considered comprehensive by any definition, and simply aim to serve as a referential (and searchable) summary of the source material.

The chapters often include direct quotes and most especially when terms are initially defined.

> Direct quotes will appear as html `blockquotes` like this one

*NOTE: Some chapters and/sections are considered more supplemental than critical to understanding the concepts and are intentionally not summarized or summarized more succinctly.*
