# Selecting appropriate analyses

## 5.1 Which analyses to perform?

Questions that arise:

- What descriptive measures should used to examine the data?
- What statistical analyses should be performed?

Steps to take:

- Cleaning and transformation
- Obtain statistics and graphs
- Calculate the number of missing values for each variable

# 5.3 Appropriate statistical measures

**Table 5.1 Descriptive measures depending upon Steven's scale**

|Classification|Graphical Measure|Measures of the center of a distribution|Measures of the variability of a distribution|
|----|----|----|----|
|Nominal|Bar graphs<br>Pie charts<br>|Mode|Binomial or multinomial variance|
|Ordinal|Histogram|Median|Range<br>P<sub>75</sub> - P<sub>25</sub>|
|Interval|Histogram areas measurable|Mean = *X*|Standard deviation = *S*|
Ratio|Histogram areas measurable|Geometric mean<br>Harmonic mean|Coefficient of variation = *S/X*
