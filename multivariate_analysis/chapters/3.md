# Preparing for data analysis

## 3.4 Organizing the data

**Missing values**

Missing values can occur both when a respondent fails provide any information (**unit nonresponse**) or when a respondent omits a value (**item nonresponse**).

When unit nonresponse occurs skewing data towards a particular subgroup, various techniques can be applied as a remedy including:

  - reporting a weighted average and not an overall average
  - assigning an observation a weight and entering the weight as a variable

**Detecting Outliers**

An investigator should use discretion in removing or reporting outliers. One technique is to run the analyses twice with and without outliers to find out if there is an appreciable difference in the results.

> Most investigators would hesitate, for example, to report rejecting a null hypothesis if the removal of an outlier would result in the hypothesis not being rejected.

## 3.5 Example: Depression Study

**Codebook**

A code book simply contains a list of a variables and description of each that includes how values were coded. For example, respondents who answered the item `C2`, displayed as `I felt depressed` could provide `0-3` to represent if this item applied to them rarely, sometimes, or often. See table 3.3
