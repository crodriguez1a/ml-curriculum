# Simple Regression and Correlation

## 6.2 When are regression and correlation used?

The methods in this chapter are used to study the relationship between two variables X and Y. By convention X is referred to as the **independent** or **predictor variable**, while Y is commonly called the **dependent** or **outcome variable**.

> The dependent variable is assumed to be continuous while the independent variable may be continuous or discrete

The data for regression analysis can be described as follows:

1. **Fixed-X case:** The values of X are selected or existing in nature.
1. **Variable-X case.** The values of X and Y are both random variables.

Regression and correlation analysis can be used for two main purposes:

1. **Descriptive**, where the type and strength of the relationship are examined.
1. **Predictive**, where the relationship between X and Y can be used to predict the value of Y for a give value for X.
