# Data screening and transformations

This chapter discusses applying transformations to obtain more normal distributions.

## 4.2 Common transformations

To examine common transformations, we can examine a plot of X against its transformed self. For example, a plot of logX versus X.

**Logarithm (log) to the base 10**

> Recall that logarithm is number that satisfies the relationship X=10<sup>y</sup>. That is, the logarithm of X is the power Y to which 10 must be raised to produce X.

If X can have zero or negative values, an appropriate constant may be applied.

Remember that Logarithms can be taken to any base. When taken to the familiar base `e=2.7183`, they can be called **natural logarithms**.

> The natural logarithm is used frequently in theoretical studies because of certain appealing mathematical properties.

**Power transformations (p value)**

> ...the transformation X<sup>2</sup> (X raised to the power of 2) is used frequently in statistical formulas such as computing variance

The most commonly used are X raised to the power of ½ and the inverse X raised to the power of -1

Transformations are characterized by noting the power to which X is raised using the symbol `p`.

|Square Root| Inverse | Logarithmic |
|---|---|---
p = ½ | p = -1 | p = 0

The effects of these transformations in reducing long-tailed distribution to the right are greater as the value `p` decreases from 1.

**Exponential function**

> An exponential function of X may thought of as the antilogarithm of X

The function 10<sup>x</sup> has the same shape but increases faster than e<sup>x</sup>. See figure 4.3

# 4.3 Selecting appropriate transformations

The most common distribution for continuous observation is typically referred to as **Gaussian** (or normal) distribution.
